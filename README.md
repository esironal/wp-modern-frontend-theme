## Work in progress

A yo generator for Wordpress themes using HTML5 Boilerplate, Bootstrap, Sass, Coffeescript, Backbone and Jasmine. It also creates some grunt tasks and allow you to manage your dependencies. It was inspired by Roots theme (http://roots.io/)

It also should allow you to choose between some libs(less or sass, bootstrap, foundation or pure and etc) and also set as optional the use of coffescript.
